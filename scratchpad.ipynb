This allows us to check if a triangle can be formed by taking the longest possible sides first. Then, we iterate through the sorted array and check if the current element and the next two elements form a triangle of non-zero area. To check if a triangle can be formed, we use the triangle inequality theorem, which states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side (a + b > c, a + c > b, b + c > a). Since we have the array sorted in descending order, we only need to check one case of the inequality (nums[i] < nums[i + 1] + nums[i + 2]) for each iteration. If we find a valid triangle, we return the sum of its sides as the largest perimeter. If no valid triangle is found, we return 0.',\n",

Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.\\n2.  Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is `\\'-\\'` or `\\'+\\'`. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.\\n3.  Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.\\n4.  Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. `\"123 \" -> 123`, `\"0032 \" -> 32`). If no digits were read, then the integer is `0`. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).\\n5.  If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range `[-231, 231 - 1]`, then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than `-231` should be clamped to `-231`, and integers greater than `231 - 1` should be clamped to `231 - 1`.\\n6.

       "  '# Given a `file` and assume that you can only read the file using a given method `read4`, implement a method `read` to read `n` characters. Your method `read` may be **called multiple times**.\\n**Method read4:**\\nThe API `read4` reads **four consecutive characters** from `file`, then writes those characters into the buffer array `buf4`.\\nThe return value is the number of actual characters read.\\nNote that `read4()` has its own file pointer, much like `FILE *fp` in C.\\n**Definition of read4:**\\n    Parameter:  char\\\\[\\\\] buf4\\n    Returns:    int\\nbuf4\\\\[\\\\] is a destination, not a source. The results from read4 will be copied to buf4\\\\[\\\\].\\nBelow is a high-level example of how `read4` works:\\nFile file( \"abcde `\"); // File is  \"`abcde `\", initially file pointer (fp) points to \\'a\\' char[] buf4 = new char[4]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters read4(buf4); // read4 returns 4. Now buf4 =  \"abcd \", fp points to \\'e\\' read4(buf4); // read4 returns 1. Now buf4 =  \"e \", fp points to end of file read4(buf4); // read4 returns 0. Now buf4 =  \" \", fp points to end of file`\\n**Method read:**\\nBy using the `read4` method, implement the method read that reads `n` characters from `file` and store it in the buffer array `buf`. Consider that you cannot manipulate `file` directly.\\nThe return value is the number of actual characters read.\\n**Definition of read:**\\n    Parameters:\\tchar\\\\[\\\\] buf, int n\\n    Returns:\\tint\\nbuf\\\\[\\\\] is a destination, not a source. You will need to write the results to buf\\\\[\\\\].\\n**Note:**\\n*   Consider that you cannot manipulate the file directly. The file is only accessible for `read4` but not for `read`.\\n*   The read function may be **called multiple times**.\\n*   Please remember to **RESET** your class variables declared in Solution, as static/class variables are persisted across multiple test cases. Please see [here](https://leetcode.com/faq/) for more details.\\n*   You may assume the destination buffer array, `buf`, is guaranteed to have enough space for storing `n` characters.\\n*   It is guaranteed that in a given test case the same buffer `buf` is called by `read`.\\n**Example 1:**\\n**Input:** file =  \"abc \", queries = \\\\[1,2,1\\\\]\\n**Output:** \\\\[1,2,0\\\\]\\n**Explanation:** The test case represents the following scenario:\\nFile file( \"abc \");\\nSolution sol;\\nsol.read(buf, 1); // After calling your read method, buf should contain  \"a \". We read a total of 1 character from the file, so return 1.\\nsol.read(buf, 2); // Now buf should contain  \"bc \". We read a total of 2 characters from the file, so return 2.\\nsol.read(buf, 1); // We have reached the end of file, no more characters can be read. So return 0.\\nAssume buf is allocated and guaranteed to have enough space for storing all characters from the file.\\n**Example 2:**\\n**Input:** file =  \"abc \", queries = \\\\[4,1\\\\]\\n**Output:** \\\\[3,0\\\\]\\n**Explanation:** The test case represents the following scenario:\\nFile file( \"abc \");\\nSolution sol;\\nsol.read(buf, 4); // After calling your read method, buf should contain  \"abc \". We read a total of 3 characters from the file, so return 3.\\nsol.read(buf, 1); // We have reached the end of file, no more characters can be read. So return 0.\\n**Constraints:**\\n*   `1 <= file.length <= 500`\\n*   `file` consist of English letters and digits.\\n*   `1 <= queries.length <= 10`\\n*   `1 <= queries[i] <= 500`',\n",

If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return `null`.\\nFor example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node `c1`:\\nThe test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.\\n**Note** that the linked lists must **retain their original structure** after the function returns.\\n**Custom Judge:**\\nThe inputs to the **judge** are given as follows (your program is **not** given these inputs):\\n*   `intersectVal` - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is `0` if there is no intersected node.\\n*   `listA` - The first linked list.\\n*   `listB` - The second linked list.\\n*   `skipA` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listA` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.\\n*   `skipB` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listB` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.\\nThe judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, `headA` and `headB` to your program.

There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.\\n- Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory.\\n**Example 2:**\\n**Input:** intersectVal = 2, listA = \\\\[1,9,1,2,4\\\\], listB = \\\\[3,2,4\\\\], skipA = 3, skipB = 1\\n**Output:** Intersected at '2'\\n**Explanation:** The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).\\nFrom the head of A, it reads as \\\\[1,9,1,2,4\\\\].

From the head of B, it reads as \\\\[1,5\\\\].

Each cell interacts with its [eight neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood) (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):\\n1.  Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.\\n2.  Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.\\n3.  Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.\\n4.  Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\\nThe next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously.

Since the new droplet moving left will eventually make it fall, it moves left. Notice that the droplet still preferred to move left, even though it could move right (and moving right makes it fall quicker.)\\n \\nThe third droplet falls at index k = 3.
