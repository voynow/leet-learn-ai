## function: connect_to_supabase
#### args: None
The `connect_to_supabase` function is designed to establish a connection to a Supabase database. It does this by creating a client using the Supabase URL and Key, which are retrieved from the environment variables. This function is particularly useful when you need to interact with your Supabase database, as it abstracts the connection process, making it easier and more efficient. <end>

## function: initialize_app
#### args: No arguments
The `initialize_app` function is responsible for setting up the initial state of the application. It configures the page layout, title, and icon, and initializes various session state variables, such as `show_chat`, `block`, `current_selection`, `session_id`, `conversation_id`, and `supabase`. This function is crucial for ensuring the app starts with a consistent state, and it subtly handles the creation of unique identifiers for the session and conversation, as well as the connection to Supabase, which might not be immediately obvious. <end>

## function: log_message
#### args: role, content
The `log_message` function is designed to log a message to both the console and the Supabase database. It creates a transaction dictionary with various session and message details, then inserts this transaction into the 'messages' table of the Supabase database. The function also logs the data and count of the transaction for tracking purposes. This function is particularly useful for maintaining a record of all messages in a session, and can be instrumental in debugging and user activity tracking. <end>

## function: add_message
#### args: role, content
The `add_message` function is designed to handle the addition of messages in both the session state and the block. It is particularly useful in scenarios where messages need to be displayed and simultaneously used for AI processing. The function ensures that messages are duplicated in both the session state for display purposes and the block for AI utilization.

## function: render_gif
#### args: None
The function `render_gif` is designed to render the landing page gif. It reads the gif file from the data directory, encodes it into base64 format, and then displays it on the landing page. This function is particularly useful for creating a dynamic and engaging user interface without the need for external hosting or embedding.

## function: display_landing_page
#### args: None
This function is responsible for rendering the landing page of the LeetLearn.ai application. It displays a welcome message, prompts the user to enter their OpenAI API key, and provides links to the source code and the developer's Twitter account. If an API key is entered, it sets the key, displays a welcome message from the bot, and triggers a rerun of the Streamlit app, effectively transitioning to the chat interface.

## function: parse_stream
#### args: message_placeholder, response
The `parse_stream` function is designed to parse and display chunks from a generated response. It iteratively adds each chunk of content to a full response string, which is then displayed using the message placeholder. This function is particularly useful when dealing with large responses that need to be processed in chunks, rather than all at once. It returns the full response after all chunks have been processed.

## function: handle_response
#### args: None
The `handle_response` function is a crucial part of the application, designed to work seamlessly with Streamlit. It handles the streaming mechanism, creating a completion and parsing the stream. It also gracefully handles any authentication errors that may occur, providing a user-friendly error message. The function returns the full response after marking it down.

## function: enrich_query
#### args: query
The `enrich_query` function is designed to enhance the readability of a given query by incorporating HTML tags. It replaces newline characters and spaces with corresponding HTML tags, making the query more visually appealing and easier to read. This function is particularly useful when displaying code snippets in a web-based environment.

## function: handle_chat
#### args: query
The `handle_chat` function is designed to manage user input and bot responses in a chat interface. It first enriches the user's query, then adds the user's message to the chat. It also handles the bot's response and adds it to the chat. This function is particularly useful in maintaining a smooth and interactive chat flow between the user and the bot.

## function: setup_sidebar
#### args: None
The setup_sidebar function is designed to initialize a sidebar with selectable options. It creates a title for the sidebar and populates it with a dropdown menu of options, which includes all the solutions' names plus an additional None option. The selected option from the dropdown menu is then returned by the function. This function is particularly useful for creating interactive user interfaces where users can select from a range of options. <end>

## function: display_messages
#### args: None
This function is responsible for displaying chat messages. It logs the number of messages and then iterates through them, displaying each one that does not originate from the system. The function uses markdown to format the messages, allowing for a wide range of text styles and elements.

## function: construct_chat_input
#### args: selected_option
The function `construct_chat_input` is designed to construct a chat input based on a selected option. It iterates over a predefined solutions data, comparing each solution's name with the selected option. Once a match is found, it breaks the loop and selects the corresponding problem from the solutions data. The function then returns a formatted string containing the selected option and the associated problem. This function is particularly useful when you need to generate a specific chat input based on user selection.

## function: handle_new_selection
#### args: selected_option
The function `handle_new_selection` is designed to manage new selections made in the sidebar of the application. It clears the current chat, logs the new selection, and initializes a new conversation ID and messages. It then constructs a new chat input based on the selected option and handles the chat accordingly. The function concludes by rerunning the application, which is particularly useful for maintaining a smooth user experience during interaction changes.

## function: display_chat_interface
#### args: None
This function is the main driver for displaying the chat interface. It sets up the sidebar, handles new selections, displays messages, and manages user input. It's particularly useful for managing state changes and user interactions within the chat interface. It also handles the user's chat input and processes it accordingly.

## function: show_page
#### args: None
The show_page function is responsible for displaying either the landing page or the chat interface, depending on the current session state. It checks the 'show_chat' attribute of the session state and, based on its value, calls the appropriate function to display the chat interface or the landing page. This function is particularly useful in managing user navigation within the application. <end>
