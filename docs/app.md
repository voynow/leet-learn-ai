## function: initialize_app
#### args: None
The `initialize_app` function is responsible for setting up the initial state of the application. It configures the page title and icon, and initializes various session state variables such as `show_chat`, `block`, `messages`, `current_selection`, and `clear_chat`. This function is crucial as it ensures that all necessary variables are set up correctly before the application starts running, providing a smooth user experience.

## function: add_message
#### args: role, content
The add_message function is designed to duplicate messages in both the session state and the block. The session state messages are primarily for display purposes, while the block messages are intended for AI use. This function is particularly useful for maintaining consistency between user interface and AI processing.

## function: introduce_ai
#### args: None
The function `introduce_ai` is designed to initiate a conversation with the user by generating an introductory message from the AI. This function subtly encourages user interaction by asking what the user is working on, thereby setting the stage for further engagement. It's important to note that the message is added to the conversation with the role of the bot.

## function: display_landing_page
#### args: None
The `display_landing_page` function is responsible for setting up the initial landing page of the LeetLearn.ai application. It displays a welcome message, provides an interface for the user to input their OpenAI API key, and initializes the AI chat feature upon successful key entry. The function also stores the API key in the session state for future use and reruns the app to reflect the changes. This function is crucial for user authentication and initializing the AI interaction. <end>

## function: stream_response
#### args: None
The function `stream_response` is a specialized streaming mechanism designed to work seamlessly with Streamlit. It iteratively generates and appends responses from a completion handler to a placeholder, providing a continuous stream of content. This function is integral to the application, enabling real-time updates and interactions. The final full response is returned at the end of the function.

## function: handle_chat
#### args: query
The `handle_chat` function is designed to manage a chat interaction between a user and a bot. It takes a user's query as an input, adds it to the chat history, and then generates a response from the bot using the `stream_response` function. The function also ensures that both the user's query and the bot's response are properly displayed in the chat interface.

## function: setup_sidebar
#### args: None
The setup_sidebar function is designed to initialize a sidebar with selectable options. It creates a title for the sidebar and populates it with a list of options, which includes a 'None' option and the names of various solutions. The function then returns the user's selection from these options. This function is particularly useful for creating interactive user interfaces where the user needs to select from a range of options.

## function: display_messages
#### args: None
The function `display_messages` is designed to display chat messages. It uses logging to keep track of the number of messages displayed, which can be useful for debugging and understanding user interactions. It iterates over each message in the session state, displaying the content of each message in the chat interface. This function is particularly useful in applications where real-time chat functionality is required. <end>

## function: construct_chat_input
#### args: selected_option
The construct_chat_input function is designed to process a selected option and return a formatted string that includes the selected option and the corresponding problem. This function is particularly useful when you need to match an option with its associated problem in a chat-based interface. It iterates over a predefined 'solutions' dictionary until it finds a match for the selected option, then concatenates the option and problem into a single string.

## function: handle_new_selection
#### args: selected_option
The function `handle_new_selection` is designed to manage a new selection in the sidebar of a chat interface. It clears the current chat, logs the new selection, and reruns the chat with the new selection as the input. This function is particularly useful in maintaining a clean chat interface and ensuring that the chat input is always up-to-date with the user's latest selection.

## function: display_chat_interface
#### args: None
The `display_chat_interface` function is the main function used to display the chat interface. It sets up the sidebar, handles new selections, displays messages, and handles user chat input. This function is particularly useful as it integrates all the necessary components for a chat interface, making it a one-stop solution for managing user interactions.

## function: show_page
#### args: None
The `show_page` function is responsible for managing the display of the chat interface or the landing page based on the session state. If the session state indicates that the chat should be shown, it will display the chat interface; otherwise, it will display the landing page. This function is particularly useful for managing user navigation and maintaining a clean user interface.
